# Usability and browser support research

## No Javascript

To test what would happen without Javascript enabled I turned off Javascript completely in several browsers. As expected the results were horrific on a lot of sites. Websites that consider themselves 'web apps' run mostly on Javascript and have no fallback.

There is still hope in dark times though! One example of a great website that I use regulary is [9292OV](https://www.9292.nl). Without Javascript the website still works perfectly and it shows that Javascript was truly used as an enhancer rather than a main feature. Instead of flashy same-page results you went to another page, but still got the same results. There was also a lack of autocomplete. All great things that enhance the experience, but the website works fine without them.

## No mouse/touchpad

To research how browsers and websites react to users who can't use a mouse of touchpad I disabled my touchpad completely for the duration of several hours. Within this time I visited several sites I use on a regular basis to check whether or not I could still perform the tasks at hand.
