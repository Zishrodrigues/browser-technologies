# Usability and browser support research

## No Javascript

To test what would happen without Javascript enabled I turned off Javascript completely in several browsers. As expected the results were horrific on a lot of sites. Websites that consider themselves 'web apps' run mostly on Javascript and have no fallback.

There is still hope in dark times though! One example of a great website that I use regulary is [9292OV](https://www.9292.nl). Without Javascript the website still works perfectly and it shows that Javascript was truly used as an enhancer rather than a main feature. Instead of flashy same-page results you went to another page, but still got the same results. There was also a lack of autocomplete. All great things that enhance the experience, but the website works fine without them.

Another website I use regularly is [reddit](https://www.reddit.com). Without Javascript the website works fine. Reddit is a great example of a website that focuses on sharing content rather than a app-like experience.

## No mouse/touchpad

To research how browsers and websites react to users who can't use a mouse of touchpad I disabled my touchpad completely for the duration of several hours. Within this time I visited several sites I use on a regular basis to check whether or not I could still perform the tasks at hand.

I've come to the conclusion that it's a true shame how a lot of websites don't seem to care, or realize the hardships they put people in when they can't use a mouse. Most people do either have a mouse of touchpad, but there are always those that can't use them for physical reasons or technical problems. I've yet to find a good example of a website that does focus states correct..

This has inspired me to try and to better.
