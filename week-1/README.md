# Usability and browser support research

## No mouse/touchpad

To research how browsers and websites react to users who can't use a mouse of touchpad I disabled my touchpad completely for the duration of several hours. Within this time I visited several sites I use on a regular basis to check whether or not I could still perform the tasks at hand.
