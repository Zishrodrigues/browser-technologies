# JS - accordion

This accordion is made using vanilla Javascript. This means most browsers will be able to render it with no problems. This fallback is for people who either have Javascript turned off or can't use Javascript.

## Example code

```
<section class="accordion">
  <section>
    <h1>First tab</h1>
    <p>Accordion content, if JS is not supported this text is still seen.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Second tab</h1>
    <p>Accordion content, if JS is not supported this text is still seen.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Third tab</h1>
    <p>Accordion content, if JS is not supported this text is still seen.<p>
  </section>
</section>

```
If Javascript isn't used, the headers and paragraphs will still be shown.
