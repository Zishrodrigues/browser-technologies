# Browser Technologies - Final [List Demo]

For this project I created a demo of a address list build using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The project has multiple fallbacks in place in case a user doesn't have access to css or javascript, some using serverside rendering.

## Installing the project

Using the following steps you can install and use the app locally.

#### Cloning or downloading the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Zishrodrigues/browser-technologies.git
```
#### Installing the required dependencies
In the folder week-3-FINAL run the following command:
```
$ npm install
```
Wait for the required npm packages to install and proceed further.

#### Starting and running the server
Make sure port 3000 isn't being used by another project. If this is the case run the following command
```
$ npm start
```
If you get the message ```app listening in port 3000 ``` the server started successfully on localhost:3000.

## Project overview

My demo is a dynamic list of contacts.
